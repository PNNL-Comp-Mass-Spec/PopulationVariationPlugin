# __<span style="color:#D57500">Population Variation (Skyline Plugin)</span>__
A Population Variation plug-in for the [Skyline software program](https://skyline.ms/project/home/software/Skyline/begin.view) that can assist researchers in determining whether their target peptides have known mutations in the general human population.

### Description
In the context of clinical or population studies using targeted proteomics (MRM/SRM), a peptide with a high natural variation is problematic. Subjects with the minor allele have a different amino acid sequence. Therefore, the targeted approach of MRM/SRM which isolates a specific m/z would register a null or noise value for the peptide target, confounding downstream analysis.

The Population Variation plug-in for the [Skyline software program](https://skyline.ms/project/home/software/Skyline/begin.view) can assist researchers in determining whether their target peptides have known mutations in the general human population. Three kinds of mutations that alter protein coding sequences are reported: non-synonymous variants that change a single amino acid, and frame-shift and stop-gain mutations that alter all downstream amino acids.
